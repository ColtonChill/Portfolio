## Projects 
This repository constrains several examples of my own projects as well as example assignments for my students. 3 of each.  
_Note: I am not the soul contributor for these examples. I have only modified/simplified these assignments (as well as provide example code) to make them suitable for highschool students. Credit goes to the faculty of USU's CS Department._

My own projects currently include (in addition to the rest of my github) a fractal generator, a multi-threaded asynchronous Pi calculator, and a Vue based weather webpage.

The Example assignments include a remedial post "Hello World" assignment, an intermediate Image Decryption, and more advanced Bingo Card Generator.

## About Me 
I'm a Junior studying Computer Science at Utah State University, and plan on pursuing a MS degree in Machine Learning.  
I've worked at the University for a year as a Computer Science tutor, helping students with everything from Compiler Construction to Web-Dev.  
Covering such a wid range of possible topics has been *"instructive"* to say the least. Aside from the baptism of fire that job has entailed, what I learned was been of inestimable value. Collaboration, Debugging, Rapid Problem Solving, Communication, and Teamwork/Leadership are all skills I've developed.  
However, best of all, teaching has introduced to me one of greatest passions in life. It has been one of the most rewarding experiences I've had and I hope to ultimately return/retire into academia.
