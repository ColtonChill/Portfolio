# Example Assignment for Potential Students

Each of these projects are examples of assignments that are meant to challenge students in an interesting way, provide learning opportunities, and expand students ability to dynamically apply there skills to real life problems.  
*Note all of these problems are meant for beginner students and represent starting, mid, and end points in the course*


## Raptor math (intro)
This assignment is relatively simple exercise in understanding a story problem and writing it in code. Ideally this is the first assignment given to a student after "Hello World".

## Secret Image (intermediate) *c++*
This project requires student to understand and experiment with a complex task, read the available support, and make their own solution.
Each student is give 3 scrambled images, a description of how they were jumbled, and an explication of how the data is represented.

## Bingo (intermediate/advance) *python3*
This project is much more difficult in that it requires the students to take starter code that is intentionally non obvious and use it as the foundation for their implementation.  
The students are also given exposure to the idea of unit test, and must have each of there methods respond in accordance to the expected outputs.
